# AI Chatbot Research Project

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to explore the fundamentals of conversational AI by building a simple chatbot prototype. As someone transitioning into the AI and data field without a formal technical background, this project served as a practical way to understand how rule-based systems function, what their limitations are, and how they tie into broader topics like AI governance, prompt design, and ethical implementation.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit (for interactive front-end)  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (for project showcase)

## Implementation Overview

This prototype is a basic rule-based chatbot created using Python and Streamlit. It processes user input with conditional logic and returns predefined responses based on keyword matching. The main purpose of this implementation is educational: to build intuition about how simple chatbots work and where their limits lie.

## Key Concepts Explored

- **Conversational Flow Design:** Structuring logic to simulate natural interaction  
- **Rule-Based Systems:** Building without machine learning or NLP  
- **Prompt Engineering (Basic):** Designing inputs and outputs to guide user interaction  
- **Limitations of Simplicity:** Understanding what rule-based systems can and cannot do

## Ethics and Governance Reflections

While the technical implementation is simple, it sparks essential questions relevant to AI governance:

- What does transparency look like in chatbot responses?
- How do we prevent user misunderstanding in automated systems?
- What kind of accountability applies to non-intelligent bots?

These themes are central to modern AI policy, and this prototype serves as a sandbox for reflecting on them in a low-risk, hands-on way.

## Future Improvements

- **Expand conversation paths** to create more realistic dialogue  
- **Integrate OpenAI or other LLM APIs** for intelligent response generation  
- **Add basic intent recognition** for improved interaction flow  
- **Enable user feedback logging** to iterate based on real use

## Demo & Repository

## Conclusion

This project represents my first step into hands-on AI development and governance. It combines technical learning with critical reflection on how conversational systems interact with users and policy. Future iterations will include LLMs, logging, and dynamic conversations â€” building toward more robust and ethically-aware AI systems.
