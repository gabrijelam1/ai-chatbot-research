# AI Chatbot Research Project (Self-Initiated)

## Introduction

This research project explores the design and development of a conversational AI chatbot for the banking industry, using both ChatGPT and IBM Watson Assistant. The chatbot was designed as a proof of concept to improve digital customer service while aligning with ethical and legal standards, including the AI Act and GDPR.

With the rise of AI in financial services, chatbots have become an increasingly relevant solution for handling routine inquiries, reducing operational costs, and enhancing customer engagement. However, deploying such systems responsibly requires thoughtful prompt engineering, risk assessment, and compliance awarenessâ€”key elements explored throughout this project.

## Objectives

The key goals of this project were to:
- Develop a prototype chatbot capable of answering banking-related questions
- Explore prompt engineering techniques to improve user interaction
- Ensure the chatbot followed principles of responsible AI use and regulatory compliance
- Evaluate conversational AI platforms (ChatGPT and IBM Watson) for real-world deployment

## Tools and Technologies

The following technologies were used in the project:
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI API):** For flexible and natural conversational capabilities
- **IBM Watson Assistant:** For rule-based, enterprise-level dialogue handling
- **Prompt Engineering Techniques:** To refine chatbot responses
- **Ethical AI Frameworks:** Including the AI Act and GDPR for responsible AI design

## Methodology

The project was structured in five key phases:

1. **Literature Review:**  
   Studied industry best practices in conversational AI, regulatory concerns, and chatbot deployment in banking.

2. **Tool Selection:**  
   Selected ChatGPT for its flexibility and IBM Watson for its structure and integration support.

3. **Prototype Development:**  
   Created simple chatbot flows using prompts based on banking FAQs, including account services, transactions, and fraud reporting.

4. **Compliance Analysis:**  
   Mapped chatbot features against GDPR requirements (e.g., data minimization, transparency) and reviewed how the AI Act could impact chatbot deployment, particularly around risk classification.

5. **Evaluation:**  
   Simulated user interactions to evaluate prompt quality, accuracy, tone, and user experience across both platforms.

## Key Features of the Chatbot

- Natural language understanding for interpreting user intent
- Financial Q&A logic using both dynamic and rule-based flows
- Bias mitigation via neutral tone and inclusive prompts
- Explainable fallback mechanisms for ambiguous queries

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the project, several key challenges emerged:

- **Compliance vs. Flexibility:**  
  Balancing automation with regulatory requirements was addressed by adding rule-based guardrails and fallback messages.

- **Prompt Clarity:**  
  Some early prompts led to unclear or inconsistent answers. This was improved through iterative testing and rephrasing.

- **Ethical Risks:**  
  To reduce the chance of misinformation or bias, the chatbot was limited to pre-approved financial scenarios, and users were reminded to contact human support for sensitive issues.

## Future Improvements

Although this was a prototype-level research project, future development could include:
- Multilingual capabilities to support non-German or non-English speaking users
- Integration with secure backend systems for personalized account support
- Enhanced fraud detection using machine learning
- A governance dashboard to track chatbot compliance metrics

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insight into building a responsible, regulation-aware AI chatbot for the banking sector. It demonstrated how prompt engineering, platform evaluation, and legal frameworks like the AI Act and GDPR must work together in AI product development.

By comparing ChatGPT's generative strengths with IBM Watson's control and structure, the project highlighted trade-offs between creativity and compliance. Ultimately, this research confirms that well-designed chatbots, when guided by ethical and legal principles, can serve as powerful tools in delivering customer value while preserving trust.
