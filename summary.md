# Project Summary

This project explores the fundamentals of conversational AI through the development of a simple, rule-based chatbot built using Python and Streamlit.

The goal was to understand how non-ML chatbot logic works, reflect on its limitations, and tie it into larger themes like AI governance, prompt engineering, and ethical communication. The chatbot runs locally in a browser and responds to basic user input through hard-coded logic. While limited in functionality, it lays the groundwork for future improvements.

The prototype was also developed as part of a learning journey into AI systems and digital policy. Its development draws on EU guidance, ethical frameworks, and documentation from leading AI tools.

### Highlights:
- Built using Python and Streamlit
- Hosted via GitHub Pages (fully accessible demo)
- Explores chatbot logic, user interaction, and basic prompt design
- Connected to themes in AI transparency, accountability, and governance
- Includes full project report and references to ethical and regulatory sources

This project will continue to evolve with the integration of LLMs (like OpenAI) and real-time user feedback mechanisms.
