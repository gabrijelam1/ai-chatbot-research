# Executive Summary: AI Chatbot Research Project

This self-initiated project explores the design of a conversational AI chatbot for banking support using ChatGPT and IBM Watson Assistant. The primary goal was to develop a prototype capable of answering common customer questions while aligning with AI governance principles, including GDPR and the EU AI Act.

The chatbot was built as a proof of concept, focusing on responsible prompt engineering, natural language understanding, and ethical deployment. Testing revealed the strengths of generative AI (ChatGPT) in delivering flexible and natural conversations, alongside the control and structure of IBM Watson in enterprise environments.

The project evaluated key factors such as prompt clarity, fallback handling, and user experience, while identifying solutions for balancing automation with legal compliance. A lightweight knowledge base was created using prompts focused on banking services, with fallback strategies to handle sensitive or ambiguous queries.

By comparing AI platforms and assessing compliance risks, the project highlighted important trade-offs between innovation and responsibility. It concludes that well-designed, governance-aware chatbots can improve digital banking experiences without compromising transparency or trust.

This project reflects applied knowledge in AI governance, prompt engineering, and ethical AI strategy, especially within regulated industries.
