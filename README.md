# AI Chatbot Research Project

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and Streamlit to explore the fundamentals of conversational AI, prompt engineering, and AI governance.

This project serves as an entry point for understanding chatbot logic, how rule-based systems operate, and how they connect to broader ethical and governance considerations in AI development.

## Features

- Built in **Python** using **Streamlit**  
- Runs entirely client-side — no backend or LLM required  
- Basic chatbot logic using keyword-based routing  
- Designed with ethical questions and governance themes in mind  
- Includes detailed report and academic/policy references

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **GitHub Pages** (for deployment)
- Markdown (.md) files for report and documentation

## Project Goals

- Learn the foundations of chatbot development
- Reflect on transparency, fairness, and user trust in conversational systems
- Build a project grounded in AI governance concepts
- Provide a platform for future integration of OpenAI or other LLMs

## Future Improvements

- Integrate LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API) for smarter responses  
- Expand conversation flows with dynamic prompts  
- Add intent recognition or keyword expansion  
- Collect basic feedback for iterative improvements
